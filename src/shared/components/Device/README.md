# Device ðŸ“±

A generic component to get access to the device's important infos.

### API

**No props needed**. If you want to change anything, you'll have to modify `src/components/Device/index.js` but also `<Device.Provider />` at the root of the project (`src/index.js`).

### Example

```jsx
/* @flow */
import React from 'react'
import { SafeAreaView, Text } from 'react-native'
import Device from '@components/Device'

const MyComponent = (): React$Element<*> => (
  <SafeAreaView>
    <Device.Consumer>
      {({ appState, height, isConnected, platform, width }) =>
        console.log(/* choose your weapon ðŸ˜› */)
      }
    </Device.Consumer>
  </SafeAreaView>
)

export default MyComponent
```
